# AdventOfCode2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. It is organized by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) and the challenge takes place every year from 1st of Dec until Christmas. I suggest you try it out next time.

For 2023 I decided to go with Python. Python is a great language to solve both small and large challenges efficiently.
